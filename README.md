# TelecomDownloader
This script that I made run on Miniconda is used to get from TIM servers the lastest archive with the current status of activation of its FTTC Cabinet.

This script has no user friendly functions, since is intended for a private use by people with minimum programming skills. 

I can't ensure further modifications or upgrades (GUI, CLI commands, etc) since it does enough for what I need. 

A nice upgrade could be the creation of a telegram bot that does the work at specific times (on mondays and wednesday, that are the days of TIM update of the file) and send 
message of the updated status.
